# Data-Forecasting
Developing Machine Learning models for data forecasting using plethora of algorithms i.e. Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, PCA,  K-means clustering, Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, &amp; Neural Networking, also evaluating every model’s performance using Error rate (MSE, R2, RMSE, MAE, &amp; MAPE).
